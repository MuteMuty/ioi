\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a novel approach to game control mechanisms through the implementation and evaluation of a pitch-controlled mobile game. We propose a real-time pitch detection system that enables precise control of in-game elements through vocal modulation. The implementation focuses on minimizing latency while maintaining accurate pitch detection for real-time gaming applications. Through qualitative evaluation, we assess the system's usability and accessibility factors. Our work contributes to the growing field of alternative input methods in human-computer interaction and accessible gaming, particularly highlighting the potential for voice-controlled interfaces in interactive applications.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background and Motivation}
Voice-controlled interfaces have emerged as a significant research area in human-computer interaction (HCI), with applications ranging from assistive technologies to entertainment systems. While speech recognition systems have been extensively studied, pitch detection as a continuous control mechanism remains relatively unexplored, particularly in interactive applications. This research addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating a novel pitch-controlled gaming system.

\subsection{Objectives}
The primary objectives of this project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developing a mobile game controlled entirely through voice pitch.
    \item Showcasing the potential of pitch detection as an interactive input in real-time applications.
    \item Providing a unique and engaging gameplay experience that prioritizes accessibility and novelty.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges in Traditional Control Schemes}
Traditional touch-based controls have limitations, particularly for individuals with motor impairments. Moreover, they often fail to provide novel user experiences in gaming. By introducing pitch-controlled gameplay, this project addresses these challenges, offering an intuitive and inclusive alternative.

\section{Existing Approaches}
\subsection{Existing Pitch-Controlled Applications}
Applications like Perfect Pitch Challenge \cite{perfectpitch1, perfectpitch2} have utilized pitch detection for educational purposes. However, their focus remains limited to music or simple tasks, lacking the complexity and dynamism of a full-fledged game.

\subsection{Alternative Voice-Control Mechanisms}
Speech recognition has been widely adopted in voice-controlled systems. However, it lacks the fluid, continuous control offered by pitch detection. Unlike predefined commands, pitch control allows for nuanced interactions, as demonstrated in this project.

\subsection{Overview of Popular Game Frameworks}
While Unity and Unreal are popular game development platforms, Flutter \cite{flutterOverview} was chosen for its rapid development capabilities and superior cross-platform support. FlutterAudioCapture and PitchDetector were seamlessly integrated, enabling real-time pitch processing.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Tools and Frameworks}
\textbf{Flutter Framework}: The choice of Flutter allows for simultaneous development for Android and iOS. It ensures a smooth user experience with native-like performance. \\
\textbf{FlutterAudioCapture and PitchDetector}: These tools form the backbone of the project, enabling accurate audio input capture and pitch analysis.

\subsection{System Design}
\textbf{Input Capture Mechanism}: Audio input is captured using the device microphone and fed into the pitch detection pipeline.  \\
\textbf{Pitch Processing Pipeline}: Captured audio is analyzed to extract pitch, which is then mapped to game actions.  \\
\textbf{State Management}: The game's various states, including running, pausing, and restarting, are managed using robust state management techniques.

\subsection{Game Mechanics}
The game replaces traditional inputs with voice pitch control. Players navigate obstacles by modulating their voice pitch, creating a unique interaction model.

\subsection{Dynamic Challenges}
The game incorporates dynamically generated obstacles that appear in rapid succession, requiring players to navigate carefully using their voice pitch. This design introduces a layer of challenge and excitement, ensuring that the gameplay remains engaging and stimulating.
